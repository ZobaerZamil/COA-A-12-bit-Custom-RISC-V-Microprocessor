# 12-bit-Custom-RISC-V-Microprocessor

1. In this project, I designed the Datapath with R-type, I-type, J-type ISA.
2. For performing operations, I designed 12-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit and 12-bit Register file.
3. For Automation, I designed a Control Unit.

4. I use C languange to make the assembler which converts the assembly instructon into Binary format and Hexa format.
