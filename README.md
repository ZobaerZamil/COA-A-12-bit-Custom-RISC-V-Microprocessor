# 12-bit-Custom-RISC-V-Microprocessor

## 1. ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
  In this project, I designed the Datapath with R-type, I-type, J-type ISA.
 
## 2. Assembler
  I use C languange to make the assembler which converts the assembly instructon into Binary format and Hexa format.
  
## Processor
  For performing operations, I designed 12-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit and 12-bit Register file.
  For Automation, I designed a Control Unit.
